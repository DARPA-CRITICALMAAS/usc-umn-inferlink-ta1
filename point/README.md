### Point symbol extraction based on object detection approach 

## Model 
For extracting point symbol classes whihc are seen during the training process, we leveraged YOLOv8 object detection model.
More information about the model can be found <a href='https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics'> here </a>

## Data preporcessing 
We pre-processed the data for formated as an input of the YOLOv8 object detection model
